他大舅他二舅都是他舅，<br/>
高桌子低板凳都是木头。<br/>
走一步退一步等于没走，<br/>
一头驴两头牛都是牲口。<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;― 老秦腔民歌
<br/><br/>
I would rather be ashes than dust.<br/>
I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.<br/>
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.<br/>
The function of man is to live, not to exist.<br/>
**I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them**.<br/>
I shall use my time.<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;― Jack London
