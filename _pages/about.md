I am an Associate Professor at [Central China Normal University](https://www.ccnu.edu.cn/). With the university, I am affiliated with the School of Computer Science, the Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Smart Learning, and National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center for Network Media.

Previously, I was a Lecturer/Researcher at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/) in the Natural Language Processing Group. I obtained my PhD at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/) supervised by Prof. [Kees van Deemter](http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/) and Dr. [Chenghua Lin](https://chenghualin.wordpress.com/). I received a Master degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh (MSc); and a Bachelor degree in e-Commerce Engineering with Law from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (B.B.A) and Queen Mary University of London (B.Eng). I have interned at Samsung AI Lab (2021), Microsoft Research Asia (2019), and Samsung Research Center Beijing (2016-2017).
