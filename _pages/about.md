About Me
======

I'm a PhD student in [Computing Science department](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/index.php) at [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/). I am supervised by Prof. [Kees van Deemter](http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/) and Dr. [Chenghua Lin](https://chenghualin.wordpress.com/). I am also affilliated with [Computational Linguistics in AberdeeN (CLAN)](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/natural-language-generation-187.php) research group. My primary research interest is in [Natural Language Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation), especially for Mandarin. More specifically, in the Theoretical Natural Language Generation, for example, the [Referring Expression Generation](http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/8956). Nevertheless, I still do some work on Practical Natural Language Generation, like the work related to [SimpleNLG](https://github.com/simplenlg/simplenlg).

Before came to Aberdeen, I was a research internship in Natural Language Understanding group of Language Computing Lab at Samsung Research Center Beijing. Before that, I finished my master degree in Artificial Intelligence at Unversity of Edinburgh and my specialist was Natural Language Processing. I did my under-graduate in e-Commerce Engineering with Law at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Queen Mary University of London.
