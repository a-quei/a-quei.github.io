I'm a PhD Candidate in [Department of Information and Computing Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-information-and-computing-sciences) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/). I am supervised by Prof. [Kees van Deemter](http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/) and Dr. [Chenghua Lin](https://chenghualin.wordpress.com/). I am also affiliated with Natural Language Processing Group in Utrecht University. I am supported by the China Scholarship Council.

In the summer of 2019, I was a research intern in the Knowledge Computing group at the Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA). Before came to Utrecht, I was a PhD candidate in [Computing Science department](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/index.php) at [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/) for nearly a year. Before that, I was a intern in the Natural Language Understanding group of Language Computing Lab at Samsung Research Center Beijing. I obtained my master degree (MSc) in Artificial Intelligence at University of Edinburgh. I did my under-graduate in e-Commerce Engineering with Law at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (B.B.A) and Queen Mary University of London (B.Eng).


#### Research

My primary research interest is in [Natural Language Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation), especially for Mandarin. More specifically, my PhD topic is on more theoretical aspects of the natural language generation, e.g., [Referring Expression Generation](http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/8956), Quantified Description Generation and so on.
