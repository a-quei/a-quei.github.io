About Me
======

I'm a PhD student in [Department of Information and Computing Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-information-and-computing-sciences) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/). I am supervised by Prof. [Kees van Deemter](http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.vdeemter/pages/) and Dr. [Chenghua Lin](https://chenghualin.wordpress.com/). I am also affilliated with Natural Lanaguage Processing Group in Utrecht University. My primary research interest is in [Natural Language Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation), especially for Mandarin.

Before came to Utrecht, I was a PhD candidate in [Computing Science department](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/ncs/departments/computing-science/index.php) at [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/) for nearly a year. Before that, I was a research internship in Natural Language Understanding group of Language Computing Lab at Samsung Research Center Beijing. Before that, I finished my master degree in Artificial Intelligence at Unversity of Edinburgh and my specialist was Natural Language Processing. I did my under-graduate in e-Commerce Engineering with Law at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and Queen Mary University of London.
